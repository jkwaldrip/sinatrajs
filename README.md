# Sinatrajs

Hi!  This is just a little starter framework using Sinatra to load a static site
with Bootstrap and jQuery included from CDNs.  Feel free to use it if you like.

_NOTE_ -- Check the branches for different starting structures. :)

## Installation

Clone this repository locally:

    $ git clone git@github.com:jkwaldrip/sinatrajs.git

Install the dependencies:

    $ cd sinatrajs
    $ bundle install

## Usage

This app can be run from the executable app.rb:

    $ cd sinatrajs
    $ ./app.rb

This project also includes the 'rerun' gem as a development dependency, if you prefer:

    $ rerun app.rb

The [rerun](https://github.com/alexch/rerun) gem allows app servers to be reloaded if changes are detected.
Depending on what you're building on this starter framework, this may not be necessary at all.
